i am david, i was born in the uk and have 4 siblings. My professional background is in supplychain management 

At some point in my proffesional life i would like to work abroad. 

I have chosen fintech as a career path to open some new doors in my career and hopefully learn a thing or two about both crypto and fiat currency markets.
